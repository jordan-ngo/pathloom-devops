This repository contains two files. A permutations.py a file containg a simple permutations 
function that takes in any data type and converts it to a sorted list. Another, test_perm.py
which contains a comprehensive suite of unit tests to validate the functionality of
permutations.py

This repository also includes a continuous integration (CI) configuration file, python-ci.yml, which 
automates the testing and setup process for Python projects using GitHub Actions.
